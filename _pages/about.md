Hola! I am _Ruyman Reyes Castro_, a Software Engineer with background in High Performance Computing and extensive experience in programming models and heterogeneous platforms.

I hold a PhD from University of La Laguna (Spain). I completed my dissertation, named [Directive based approach to Heterogeneous Computing](https://riull.ull.es/xmlui/handle/915/106), in December 2012, while working as Application Developer in the [Edinburgh Parallel Computing Center (EPCC)](http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk). I moved later in December 2013 to [Codeplay Software](http://www.codeplay.com) as Compiler Engineer. 

After doing a single compiler patch, I moved to Research Runtime Engineer in, what is now known as, [ComputeCpp](http://www.computecpp.com). 

Currently I am Principal Software Engineer in Programming Models, leading the ComputeCpp team (9+ people) and help coordinate the company strategy in SYCL, C++ and Safety critical standards.
